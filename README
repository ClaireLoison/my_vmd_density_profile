The Density Profile Tool is a VMD analysis plugin that computes 1-D
projections of various atomic densities. The computation is performed
in a single frame, a trajectory, or averaged over multiple frames.

    Atomic density, i.e. average number of atoms
    Mass density
    Charge density
    Electron density, i.e. average number of electrons.
